# Skill writing conventions

How to write the prose inside `.claude/skills/`. These conventions cover the body of every
`SKILL.md`, every `evals.md`, and every file under a skill's `references/`.

**Out of scope.** These conventions do not govern:

- **The `name` and `description` frontmatter fields.** Those follow Anthropic's skill-authoring
  guidance, which `reviewing-skills` grades as checklist items `A1`, `A2`, and `A3`. The
  `description` is matched against the user's phrasing to decide whether to load the skill, so
  rewording it for prose style degrades discovery. Leave both fields alone.
- **Published site copy**, which follows the voice in [brand.md](../../brand.md).
- **Code, code comments, and the literal command text inside fenced blocks.**
- **Commit messages**, which follow
  [commit-conventions.md](../../development/conventions/commit-conventions.md).

**Why these conventions exist.** An agent reads skill prose and then decides what to do. Every
ambiguity in that prose is a branch the agent can take wrongly. The conventions below target
ambiguity, and only ambiguity. They are not a style guide, and they are not a readability standard.

**Where they come from.** These conventions adapt ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, Issue 9
(ASD, 2025-01-15), a controlled-language standard for technical documentation. This repository
adopts the part of that standard that removes ambiguity. It rejects the part that targets human
reading speed, because an agent does not have the reading constraints the standard was designed for.

## The conventions

### 1. Name the actor

Write in the active voice. Passive constructions hide who acts, and in an instruction the actor is
the most important word. "The message is rejected" leaves the agent to guess whether the skill, the
hook, or the model does the rejecting. Write "the hook rejects the message" instead.

### 2. Write one instruction per sentence

Give each sentence one thing to do. Two instructions in one sentence become one instruction that the
agent half-follows. The exception is two actions that must happen at the same time.

### 3. Put the condition before the command

When a step applies only sometimes, open with the condition, add a comma, then give the command. The
agent decides whether the step applies before it reads what the step does. Write "When the branch is
`main`, warn the user" rather than "warn the user if the branch is `main`".

### 4. Keep notes informative and instructions imperative

A note gives information. A note never carries a rule. When an aside contains something the agent
must do, it is not an aside — promote it into a numbered step. This convention matters most in
blockquotes and parentheticals, where normative text hides easily.

### 5. Give every guardrail a consequence

A prohibition without a reason is a rule the agent cannot weigh against a conflicting instruction.
State the risk or the result. Write "Never run `git add -A` without the user's say-so, because it
stages unrelated work into a commit the user cannot review" rather than the prohibition alone.

### 6. Make every referent explicit

Never leave a bare "this", "that", "it", or "they". Follow the demonstrative with the noun it refers
to. Write "this check", "that file", "the baseline" instead. A pronoun with two plausible antecedents
is a coin flip.

### 7. Name the whole set

Never close a list with "etc.", "and so on", or "and similar". An open set invites the agent to
invent members of it. When the set is genuinely open, say what the membership test is.

### 8. Use precise verbs

Replace phrasal verbs with single verbs that carry one meaning. "Set up", "roll back", "check in",
and "point to" each carry several. Write "configure", "revert", "commit", and "reference".

### 9. Use one term per concept

Pick one name for each thing and keep it everywhere, across `SKILL.md`, `evals.md`, and the
references. "Gate", "quality gate", and "preflight" for one concept force the agent to decide whether
they mean the same thing.

### 10. Keep noun stacks to three words

A run of four or more nouns has more than one valid reading. When a term needs more words, write it
in full once, then define a shorter form or join the words that act as a unit with hyphens.

### 11. Prefer a verb to a noun built from a verb

Write "validate the input" rather than "perform validation of the input". The verb form names the
action directly, and it removes the empty verb that would otherwise carry the sentence.

### 12. Mechanics

- Use American spelling.
- Write out contractions in normative sentences.
- Use an article or a demonstrative before a noun, unless the line is a heading or a list label.
- Use hyphens to bind words that modify each other.

## What is deliberately not here

**There is no sentence-length rule and no word-count rule. Do not add one.**

The source standard caps sentences at 20 words in procedures and 25 in descriptions, and it defines a
word-counting apparatus to make those caps checkable. This repository rejects the caps and the
apparatus together.

The sentences that exceed those caps are the guardrails that bind a condition to an action. Splitting
them to satisfy a word count risks breaking that binding, which creates the ambiguity these
conventions exist to remove. A long sentence that names its actor, carries one instruction, and puts
its condition first is already clear. Length is not the defect these conventions are looking for.

## Traceability

Each convention above condenses one or more rules from the source standard. The mapping is recorded
here so that a reader who knows the standard can see what was taken.

| 10. Noun stacks                 | 2.1, 2.2, 8.2                      |

The standard's remaining rules (1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 1.12, 3.1, 9.1, 9.2) depend on its controlled
dictionary, which this repository does not adopt.

The `reviewing-skills` skill grades against this document as checklist items `R7` through `R11`.
